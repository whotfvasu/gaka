# Mistakes I Made in College – Lessons from IIIT Nagpur

College is a journey of growth, exploration, and, inevitably, mistakes. As a pre-final year student at IIIT Nagpur, I’ve made my fair share of missteps—some small, some significant. But each one has been a stepping stone toward learning and self-improvement.

---

## 1. Prioritizing Grades Over Learning

In my early semesters, I focused too much on grades rather than deep learning. Memorizing for exams rather than understanding concepts led to short-term success but long-term struggles.

### What I Learned:
- Mastering core subjects is more valuable than scoring high on tests.
- Practical application of concepts matters more than theoretical knowledge.
- A balance between academics and projects is key to real growth.

---

## 2. Ignoring Development and Open-Source Contributions

I initially underestimated the value of working on real-world projects and contributing to open-source. While I spent time on competitive programming, I didn’t build enough projects early on.

### The Impact:
- Lack of practical experience in my early years.
- Missed out on networking opportunities with developers.
- Had to rush project-building later to strengthen my resume.

### Lesson:
- Start working on projects early, even if they’re small.
- Contribute to open-source—it teaches collaboration and problem-solving.
- Balance DSA with full-stack and backend development.

## 3. Not Leveraging Networking and Mentorship

For a long time, I hesitated to connect with seniors, alumni, or industry professionals. IIIT Nagpur has an emerging network, but I didn’t take full advantage of it early on.

### Missed Opportunities:
- Career guidance from experienced seniors.
- Industry exposure through networking.
- Internships and referrals that could have been easier to secure.

### Fix:
- Engage in tech communities, LinkedIn networking, and alumni interactions.
- Attend hackathons, meetups, and tech talks.
- Ask for guidance—it’s never too late to learn from others.

---

## 4. Procrastinating on Internships and Research Papers

I delayed applying for internships, assuming opportunities would come naturally. I also didn’t explore research projects when I had the time.

### Consequences:
- Tougher competition for internships in later years.
- Less experience in technical writing and research.
- Missed out on early hands-on exposure to industry problems.

### What I’d Do Differently:
- Start internship hunting from the second year itself.
- Work on research papers with professors early.
- Explore diverse domains before specializing.

## 5. Not Taking Care of Health and Mental Well-being

Between assignments, coding, and exams, I often neglected my physical and mental health. Sleep deprivation, poor diet, and stress took a toll.

### How It Affected Me:
- Reduced productivity and creativity.
- Increased burnout and stress.
- Less energy to explore personal passions.

### Change:
- Maintain a healthy routine with exercise and proper sleep.
- Take breaks and socialize—college is more than just academics.
- Develop a growth mindset instead of chasing perfection.

## Conclusion

Mistakes are part of the learning process. While I can’t go back and change my early years, I can ensure I make better choices now. For those in their early college days—focus on real learning, explore opportunities, and take care of yourself. Growth happens when we reflect and improve.
