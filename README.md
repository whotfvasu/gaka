Gaka Portfolio is a free and open-source personal website template that I built using Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Motion. Designed for developers, designers, and founders, it combines minimalism with delightful animated components powered by [Motion-Primitives](https://motion-primitives.com).
